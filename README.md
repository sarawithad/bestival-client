# bestival: AngularJS Client

Am I the only having trouble keeping track of all the music festivals that are available to attend across the US, not to mention the world, every year? I doubt it. With all these options, how do I decide which festival is BEST for ME? Enter bestival. bestival is a music festival curation and recommendation engine that will give you recommendations of the BEST festival(s) to attend based on your personal preferences of artists, genres, location and month of year.

## Getting Started:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites:

The bestival client requires the bestival API found here: [bestival API](https://github.com/sarawithad/bestival-API)

Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm?utm_source=house&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=free%20orgs&utm_term=Install%20npm)

Install http-server:

```
npm install http-server -g
```

### Installing:

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/sarawithad/bestival-client.git
```

Click [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en) and install the Allow-Control-Allow-Origin Chrome extension to handle CORS issues.
